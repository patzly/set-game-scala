This is an unofficial Scala version of the SET game for Software Engineering classes at HTWG Konstanz.

The object of the game is to identify a 'SET' of three cards from 12 cards placed face up on the table. Each card has four features:

* **Number:** 1, 2, 3
* **Symbol:** oval, squiggle, diamond
* **Shading:** solid, striped, outlined
* **Color:** red, green, purple

A set contains of three cards in which each of the cards' features, looked at one-by-one, are the same on each card, or, are different on each card.
If two cards are the same and one card is different in any feature, then it is not a SET. A SET must be either all the same or all different in each individual feature.

## Features

* Singleplayer/Multiplayer mode
* Multiple rounds possible
* Easy start mode
* Interactive GUI, state-representation as text-based UI
